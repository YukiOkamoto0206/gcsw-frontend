# GCSW Frontend UI

This is the frontend component of Greenfield Community Science Workshop Database Project, created as part of the service learning requirement for CST-462S at California State University, Monterey Bay. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

[GCSW Backend](https://github.com/PedroG1018/gcsw-backend)

## Routes

### `/` Sign In Page (Unprotected Route)

The default route is the sign in page for participants who come into the workshop. This is the only unprotected route; participants shouldn't have to log in to sign in for the day. Upon entering their ID, their information gets filled out automatically if they had already been registered in the MongoDB database. Participants are only allowed to sign in once per day.

### `/participants` Participant Attendance Page (Protected Route, requires Login)

This route leads to the participant attendance page, listing all of the participants who have signed in on the selected date through the Date Picker. Each participant entry in the table has options to edit their information, leading to the  `/edit` route, and to delete the selected entry. This page also includes a button to export a list of participants to an Excel file. 

###  `/edit/{id}` Edit Participant Page (Protected Route, requirs Login)

This route leads to the edit participant page, allowing one to edit and update a previously registered participant's information. Changes are reflected throughout the app, included the Participant Attendance and Sign In pages. Here is where one can delete a participant permanently as well, erasing all of their sign-in entries and information from the app. The route requires the participant's Object ID from their MongoDB document to be passed in as a URL parameter.

## Authentication

This application is secured using Auth0's authentication services. To access <b>protected routes</b>, one must log in using the Log In button and provide the organization name and user credentials if part of that organization. For more information on the Auth0 side of this project, look through the following [document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/102R_epOAxuB2np7ODbP_3cnQCGlsfhtwmVeDspSDnL8/edit?usp=sharing).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

<b>Note: When running with local backend, change REACT_APP_SERVER_URL in .env file to http://localhost:6060/api</b>

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
